		<p>It starts with curiosity, a human state which must be seized whenever it presents itself. For me, curiosity struck while standing on a rooftop, looking down at a vacuum cleaner cord. I was a house-painter for the summer and, being the newbie of the team, it was my job to clean up the site. For some reason, cleanly wrapping the vacuum cord was a particularly dreaded chore - undoing the knotted mess a punishment. 
		Every once and a while, fortune would shine upon me, and simply pulling on the ends would result in a nice, straight cord.</p>
		<p>As I looked down a thought struck me - there must be a way to know ahead of time if this will happen. The knot must be a logical system, and by analyzing the loops and crossings, one must be able to predict the outcome. I figured, "you know, count the crossings, overs and unders, apply some formula and boom - knot or no knot." I figured someone out there must have cracked the code. But then another, wonderful impulse struck me - maybe <strong><i>I</i></strong> could crack the code! Thus began my journey.</p>

		<p>At this time I was studying physics at university, a subject which instilled upon me a particular way of approaching problems. They first thing was to strip the problem to its most basic elements and begin analysis there:</p>
		<p><strong>Mathematical Knots:</strong> It seemed the first element to remove from the equation were things like friction, tension, the properties of the specific rope or knotting medium. Clearly, many knots depend on such factors, but I decided that I was seeking something else. I was interested in knots that form simply from their configuration - from the fact that lengths of rope can't pass through each other. This was not a problem of physics, but one of mathematics - topology in specific. So I would work with an idealized rope - frictionles, unbreakable, able to stretch or slip as needed. One with ends that extend to infinity, preventing the structure from being undone.</p>
		<p><strong>Essential Characteristics:</strong> Intuitively, it seemed that the only thing of real imporance, then, were the crossings. Are they over or under? Where do they occur? It also seemed that a knot configuration should be displayed in the two-dimensional plane (plus the dimension of over/under for each crossing), since any configuration could be deformed so that no two crossings should overlap when viewed at some angle. This would make it much easier to describe and recreate certain arrangements.</p>
		<p><strong>Pulling it apart:</strong> The next step seemed then to analyze specific arrangements, see if they for knots or pull apart to straight line, and then figure out why. Again, we start with the most basic case: a single loop with a single crossing. Pulls to a straight line. Done. Ok, now on to two crossings. But wait, there are different ways to do two crossings:</p>

		<p>So this presents a problem. If I am to systematically analyze different configurations, I'm going to need a way of keeping track of them, differatiating them, and the number of crossings is not going to be enough information. I'm going to have to develop a consistent naming system.</p>

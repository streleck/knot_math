		<h1>Names Part II</h1>

		<p><strong>Over/Under:</strong> We talked about how to track where crossings occur, but, as you may have noticed, we haven't addressed whether crosses go over or under the rope. Ok. A cross over the rope gets a positive number/letter, a cross under gets a negative number/letter. I do want to say, here, that we will spend a lot of time NOT worrying about the over/under part of this. You will see here a lot of diagrams that don't specify if a cross is over or under. You will see a lot of names without any '-' symbols. This is because there is a lot that can be explored about knot structures without thinking about that extra level of complexity.</p>
		<p><strong>Starting at Zero: </strong> Another detail we didn't cover much was the first crossing. We just pretty much assimed that it was there and then moved on to the other crossings. But what about a rope configuration like this:</p>
		<img src="" alt="zero knot">
		<p>It's important that we consider this knot case. After all, this is what I want the vacuum cleaner cord to look like! We shall call this knot '0'. It seemed pretty helpful to have a zero in other fields of mathematics. Maybe it will here too!</p>
		<p><strong></strong> Now when we build a knot, we should start at 0 and start naming with the first cross. If you look at the zero knot, there are two sides, 1 and A:</p>
		<img src="" alt="zero with numbers">

		<h3>Example</h3>
		<p>Let's build and name a knot together to get a feel for what it looks like. Again, we start with zero.</p>
		<img src="" alt="zero with numbers">
		<p>To be clear, I am just choosing arbitrary crossings here. I could make any other kind of knot by making different choices. I choose for the first crossing to be 1.</p>
		<img src="" alt="zero crossing to 1">
		<p>Now we have the knot called 1. There will be five choices for the next crossing. You may notice that there are six numbers written down How can there only be five possibilities? Very observant! As you can see, section 2 is kind of locked in there. There is no way to cross be without crossing B first. We'll talk more about this more later. For now, lets cross section C.</p>
		<img src="" alt="1 crossing to 1,C">
		<p>Now we have a knot called 1,C. For the next crossing, there are eight possiblities. I'll choose C again.</p>
		<img src="" alt="1,C crossing to 1,C,C">
		<p>And now we have 1,C,C. Notice that the number of letters equals the number of crossings, which makes sense since the numbers are just a log of the crossings. Notice also that there are more and more sections each time. (although, as we will see, not neccessarily more available options after each cross) It is important to re-number the sections of rope after every crossing since they will shift as a section gets split. This can be tedious, I must admit. It gets easier with practice, but with bigger knots, there can be a lot to worry about. Knots are complicated things! Ok, lets do one more, just to make sure we've got the hang of it. This time, I will cross 1.</p>
		<img src="" alt="1,C,C crossing to 1,C,C,1">
		Now it's time to draw and name some knots on your own. There's know better way to understand things than to play around with them! What irony that I've decided to name these playing around pages "worksheets". I just think the name "playsheet" would confuse people who visit this site and don't read this paragraph.

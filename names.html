		<p>The goal is to give names to each possible knot configuaration, but not just any name will do. The names need to be unique, systematic, meaningful. The names should tell me somthing about the knot. How about if they tell me EVERYTHING (everything important, at least) about the knot? Again, what seems to be important are the crossings, and where they occur.</p>
		<p><strong>Recipe:</strong> My idea was to make it so that a knot's name is a recipe of how to make the knot. That way if you had a knot, but gave me just the name, I could recreate (in essence) the very same knot. This would, then, mean that all relevant information is contained within that name. Let's start cooking up some knots!</p>
		<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> We'll build knots by starting with the basic, single loop, and add more crossings to it. Imagine that one end of the rope is tied to a boat and one end is free. We will take that free end and cross it in different places to make different knots. If we look at the single loop, we see that there are five different ways we could make the next crossing:</p>

		<p><strong>Line Segments:</strong> It seems, then, that if we give a name to each line segment (a section of rope between any two crossings), the name of a knot could be a list of the line segments that get crossed, in the order the crossings occur. So now we just need a systematic way to name the line segments. How about we just number them, starting at the one that's tied to the boat. Like this:</p>
		<img src="" alt="numbered line segments">
		<p>We have a problem here, though. I can draw two different ways to make a crossing at line segment 1:</p>

		<p><strong>Refining the Number System</strong> This is the type of ambiguity that could undermine our whole naming system! If a name is a recipe, it should tell us exactly how to make the knot. One recipe should not produce two different possible knots. To settle this, we need to provide a bit more information: which side of the rope we are crossing. To resolve this, one side will be numbered, the other side will be lettered. Traveling from the boat (or fixed end if we want a more official sounding way to call it) the right side will be numbers, the left side letters. It should look like this:
		<img src="" alt="numbered / lettered segments">
		<p>This will be the basis of the system. We will build knots and keep track of the number associated with each crossing we make. Then the name of the knot will be a list of those crossings - a perfect recipe to recreate that same knot! There are a few more details to iron out first, which we will look at in:</p>
